## technology
The technology used to develop this app is openweathermap API, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS. The openweathermap api allows the javascript to display the desired data on the webpage. The API also makes it easy to display icons that change according to the weather of the searched city.

## Deployment
This app is still in development. When the app is fully finished the UVI index for each day will be displayed. The user will also have access to previous searches through the use of local storage. This will allow the user to "reload" information from previous searches. Also, the user might notice that if they search multiple cities, the previous data will still be displayed. When the final application is deployed the user will only see one set of results at a time.
